Description: A simple driver that reads binary data created by the ASD Inc.
    portable spectrometer instruments, such as the FieldSpec (for more information,
    see <http://www.asdi.com/products/fieldspec-spectroradiometers>). Spectral data
    can be extracted from the ASD files as raw (DN), white reference, radiance, or
    reflectance. Additionally, the metadata information contained in the ASD file
    header can also be accessed.
