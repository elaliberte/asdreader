Description: A simple driver that reads spectroscopy data created using ASD
    instruments such as the FieldSpec in R. The spectra can be extracted
    from the ASD file as raw (DN), white reference, radiance, or reflectance.
    Additionally, the metadata information contained in the ASD file header can
    also be accessed.
